A light emission puzzle game where you take basic light emission patterns and combine them to create a target emission pattern.

The object on the pilar you see when starting is the target light emission pattern you are trying to create. The row of objects behind you are the basic emission patterns. The basic patterns fall under three categories.

* Shape
* Color
* Luminance (square, sawtooth, etc.)
